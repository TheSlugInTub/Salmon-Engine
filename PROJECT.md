# Syslocked

Syslocked is a 3D quake-like game made for the showcase and for the design of Salmon Engine.

Art style: Quake but crispier and more pixelly and stylish.

## Story

There used to be a time that is now long forgotten, a time when peace was a common sight across the kingdom of Valeria.
Calm gentle storms which were gifts from the gods and an abundant store of life were given to the people of the land.
The people were content, but then a group of windmages formed the council of Irrithym, and wanted to harness the power
of these storms. They channeled the storm into sorceries and spells, building Stormshrines which harnessed the power of
the storm. The gods were furious at this and warned the windmages to stop this defiance against the storm. But the windmages 
did not listen and went to the Windpeak Mountains, and tried to channel as much of the storm as they could into a monolith
but the storm defied against them and killed the windmages, all but one of them. The gods were furious at this and cursed
all of humanity to be forever faced with eternal storms and wind. This eternal storm had a mind of its own, creating beings
out of the storm and wind. It created demons which were born from the storm itself.

You are one such being that was conceived by the storm, not fully demon, not fully human. Simply known as "The Wanderer",
you seemingly escaped Valeria into another country, the storm still ravages the outer corners of the earth.
But your first course of action in the story is to step into the land of storms once again, for an unknown reason.
You battle the storm, resting at the stormshrines, as they somehow heal you, when the gods cursed the land, the stormshrines
became powerful, defying time and space by channeling the storm. You rest at these shrines and storm brings you back to 
these shrines each time you die. You meet many jolly friends along the way, and humans who become your friends.

You battle the last remaining windmage who has gone mad, you harness the storm and gain spells and magic
and you reach the Windpeak Mountains and confront the Storm King, who tried to take on the storm but failed.
You beat the Storm King, and channel the storm within yourself, but the storm still rages on and takes you as its fuel.
But then you can overcome its attempt to consume you by doing some obscure ass shit in the game, and then you can 
take on the gods, you kill the gods, you then kill the storm, you rid the world of eternal storm and anguish,
but you also die, since you're a being of the storm.

## Mechanics

Guns, a normal shotgun like in Quake, a double barrel shotgun like in Quake, an AR-2 like in Half-Life, which can shoot big
damage pearls, and has a quick but low damage stream of bullets as its Mouse1.
The double barrel shotgun has an alt-fire of a huge explosive bomb.
Blood-borne style healing, whenever someone hits you, your temporary health goes down, but your real health stays
where it was for a few seconds, and you have to hit the enemy within that time-window to regain health.

### Movement

### Enemies

Tiny spiders that slowly hurt you.
