# Syslocked

Syslocked is a 3D quake-like game made for the showcase and for the design of Snail Engine.

Art style: Quake but crispier and more pixelly and stylish.

## Story

The coalescence have overtaken earth, and you are a robot constructed by humans in the rebellion to help defeat the coalescence.
Humans are long dead, left extinct by the coalescence and they preserved you, the robot, the couple of rebels that made you
got raided and saved you just in time in a chamber of sorts. Earth is in a ghastly state, a shell of its former self;
completely ruined by the coalescence that has taken everything from it, water, resources, plants (lots of plants are still present).
The coalescence is an extremely vast, technologically advanced alien species. They have set up bases, towers, barriers,
huge monoliths which perform computations and operations for the coalescence, and a really big citadel,
which is the base of all operations. Wildlife is still present on the planet with lizards and alien things like in Rain World.
You need to destroy the coalescence as you were built with that purpose.

## Mechanics

Guns, a normal shotgun like in Quake, a double barrel shotgun like in Quake, an AR-2 like in Half-Life, which can shoot big
damage pearls, and has a quick but low damage stream of bullets as its Mouse1.
The double barrel shotgun has an alt-fire of a huge explosive bomb.
Blood-borne style healing, whenever someone hits you, your temporary health goes down, but your real health stays
where it was for a few seconds, and you have to hit the enemy within that time-window to regain health.
