# Syslocked

Syslocked is a 3D quake-like game made for the showcase and for the design of Snail Engine.

Art style: Quake but crispier and more pixelly and stylish.

## Story

The coalescence have overtaken earth, and you are a robot constructed by the rebellion to help defeat the coalescence.
You fight aliens and the coalescence species as you head towards their base in the cosmos, and find that they are more vast,
than you could ever conceive of.

## Mechanics

Guns, a normal shotgun like in Quake, a double barrel shotgun like in Quake, an AR-2 like in Half-Life, which can shoot big
damage pearls, and has a quick but low damage stream of bullets as its Mouse1.
The double barrel shotgun has an alt-fire of a huge explosive bomb.

### Movement



### Enemies

Tiny spiders that slowly hurt you.
Coalescer, standard metrocop who has a gun.

## Gameplay

You get transported through levels via trains, that the coalescence has built as the transport system.
You get healed via oil which you can find throughout various parts of the levels.

## Levels

First level:
You wake up in crude labaratory surrounded by 3 rebels. It's set up in a tunnel system of sorts.
They all get shot by some metrocop which you have to kill (he's really easy to kill due to it being the start of the game)
